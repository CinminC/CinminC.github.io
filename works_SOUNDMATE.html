            <p>SOUNDMATE is specially designed for couples or families who are not able to see each other every day. The
                sound from their living spaces would be converted to real-time audio visualization displaying on the
                screen through programming. By sharing the visualization and sending voice messages with the microphone,
                SOUNDMATE provides a remote and privacy-keeping way to maintain the relationship between you and your
                significant other.</p>

                Sound creates a sense of immersion in the environment, and the audio visualization becomes a container
                for abstract feelings.

                Everyone has their interpretation of different tones of colors. The process of conveying messages with
                colors makes the product enhance personal characteristics and increase the sense of belonging. The
                meaning of the color can be a tacit understanding between two users, such as emotional feelings,
                occurrences, and so on.

                The expression form that allowing the visualization but unable to hear the environmental sound of the
                other party, being as a carrier of the abstract sound element. Create an interactive way to feel the
                sound with visual senses while maintaining the privacy of the user.

            <p>There are two parts of the product, "FRAME" and "CUP", connecting via the wifi signal. SOUNDMATE will
                collect the ambient sound of the other user then convert it into live dynamic soundscapes. By observing
                the changes in visualization, users could feel accompanied by one another in the same space.
                Transforming audio into visuality instead of hearing provides the product a mysterious and romantic
                presentation with privacy.</p>

            <p>The Frame, which is the displayer, is a connecting window designed for people who live in different
                places. Users could hang the Frame as their preferred location as home decoration. The screen will
                continuously receive the ambient sound from the other party's environment, transform it into real-time
                dynamic visual graphics through aesthetic computing. It allows the users to see the other party's sound
                traces of their lives. Compared to hearing the voice directly, such a subtle and low-key transformation
                not only maintains the privacy of both parties but also creates a sense of romance and mystery to their
                emotional connection.</p>

            <p>The CUP is a transmitter among users, allowing users to send voice messages with audio records and
                visualization. The receiver could speculate the moods and content of the voice message by dynamic
                notification light. Pick up the CUP to start recording/ receive messages, hang it up to stop recording/
                stop listening. Give the audio message color mark by rotating the wheel on the CUP. The color might
                represent your current feeling or a tacit understanding of both parties. The transmitter would transform
                the soundwave into dynamic lights, sending it to the other party as an indicator light of receiving
                messages.</p>
